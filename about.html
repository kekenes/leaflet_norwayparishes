	<div id="title">About</div>	
	<p>NorwayParishes.com is a free web application designed to assist those with Norwegian ancestry
	in conducting genealogical research. Kristian Ekenes created it in 2014 while working on his master’s 
	degree in Geographic Information Systems at Arizona State University. </p>
	
	<p>The primary goal of NorwayParishes.com is to provide researchers with interactive, accurate, and precise maps 
	of Norway's parish boundaries while providing 
	links to the best online genealogical research tools available filtered by geographic jurisdiction (parishes and counties).</p>
	
	<h3>The Need</h3>
	
	<p>Many people researching their family roots want to know more about the locations their ancestors lived. 
	Where did they grow up? What is it like there? What does the physical landscape look like? Did they live in a 
	city, on an island, or in the mountains? Did they live nearby other ancestors? NorwayParishes.com seeks to 
	help people answer these questions that a standard paper map may not be able to answer. Whether you’re trying 
	to identify unknown ancestors’ names and residences, obtain official documentation or vital records of ancestors, 
	or are simply trying to learn more about the region where your ancestors lived, NorwayParishes.com will make the process of answering these questions easier.</p>
	
	<p>Many tools already exist to facilitate Norwegian genealogical research online. However, few of 
	those tools provide detailed maps for each parish on a large scale. In fact, before NorwayParishes.com 
	launched no searchable, interactive, nationwide web map of Norwegian parish boundaries existed on the web. Print maps of parishes
	are available online through the <a href=”http://digitalarkivet.uib.no/geistleg/oversikt.htm” target="_blank">Norwegian National Archives</a> 
	and <a href=”https://familysearch.org/learn/wiki/en/Norway_Maps” target="_blank">FamilySearch</a>, but those 
	maps are limited in their ability to depict geographic details on large scales. Understanding the regional context of the parish of interest as well as the 
	details of locations that exist within the parish help researchers better understand the stories of their ancestors' lives as well as their place in world history.</p>
	
	<p>Unfortunately, the print maps mentioned above can become useless when a researcher desires to view specific locations (such as farms) within parish 
	boundaries. Using them to find a specific parish's boundaries can also be time consuming due to illegibility and limitations of map scale. 
	Also, parish boundaries become generalized causing them to lose a large 
	amount of detail. The way to solve these issues in the past has been to collect a series of maps and atlases in various scales
	and couple them with the use of a gazetteer. Attempting to understand the spatial relationship of locations depicted in several maps with differing scales 
	 can become time consuming and frustrating. NorwayParishes.com presents all parish, municipal and county boundaries in a scale-less map, 
	 allowing users to view the details of a parish as well as its regional context with little effort.</p>
	
	<h3>Using this Application</h3>
	
	<p>NorwayParishes.com virtually eliminates the need for people to collect and decipher multiple paper maps simultaneously. On this site, researchers can dynamically 
	filter parishes and view their boundaries based on a selection of counties and/or
	municipalities using drop down menus. One can also zoom to the parish level to view towns and farms located inside each parish. If a farm
	or place of residence falls within a specific parish boundary, it is presumed that the birth, marriage, death, and 
	census records of the former inhabitants of that farm/residence were originally kept by church leaders of that respective parish. 
	Note: that may not always be the case with current jurisdictions and naming conventions since parish boundaries changed over time (see “A Note on Parish Boundaries” below).</p>
	
	<p> Users can also use the search button in the upper-left portion of the map to search for cities, towns, farms, and other places
	 when the parish jurisdiction is unknown. That capability is designed to take the user to the desired location and indicate which parish most likely kept records for that location's inhabitants.</p>
	
	<p>Users can also view historic information about each parish, vital records specific to each geography, and view 
	a list of farm names by county along with a very basic history of most farms in the searched geographic region. </p>

	<h3>A Note on Parish Boundaries</h3>
	
	<p>The county and municipal boundaries on the web map depict the current limits of each respective jurisdiction. The parish 
	boundaries, however, reflect parishes as they were in 1979. Those limits were created with data obtained from the Norwegian Mapping Authority
	overlaid on maps provided by the Norwegian National Archives. GIS software was used to create a spatial dataset of parishes and assign each parish
	proper attribute data.</p>
	
	<h3>Future Research and Development</h3>
	
	<p>While the 1979 parish boundaries are a good guide for showing historic parish limits, they don't tell the whole story of the changing geography of parishes
	over time. NorwayParishes.com will attempt to provide additional layers of parish boundaries as they existed prior to 1979 to more accurately 
	represent how they may have looked when your ancestors were living in Norway. While that ability will take some time to complete, this application still 
	accomplishes its purpose of depicting precise parish boundaries at all scales while consolidating the best genealogical 
	research tools filtered by geography.</p>
	
	<p>Efforts will also be made to filter the gazetteer listings of farm names by parish rather than county. 
	We hope to provide other genealogical helps specific to each region as well.</p>
	
	<p>NorwayParishes.com does not claim the parish boundaries depicted here are 100 percent accurate. If errors are found, 
	please contact Kristian Ekenes by <a target="_blank" href="mailto:kekenes@asu.edu">email</a> and report the issue, 
	so it can be fixed as quickly as possible.</p>
